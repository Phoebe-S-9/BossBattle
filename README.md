About:

This project is a simple 3D interactive video game. It is inspired by a boss battle in Team Cherry's game "Hollow Knight". 

Controls:

Move the character with WASD (for directions). 
Space to jump.
Left click to attack.
Right click for the menu: reset, quit, start animation of an infection attack (which you must avoid), etc.

How to play:

Move your character (the Knight) around and attack the enemy (Nosk), with your weapon (the Nail). 
Get your enemy's health to 0 to win. 
Lose all of your health (by running into the enemy or enemy's attacks) and you'll lose the game.
